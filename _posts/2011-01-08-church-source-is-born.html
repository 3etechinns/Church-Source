title: Church Source is Born

<p>
  This week I started a repository over at 
  <a href ="https://github.com/pizzapanther/Church-Source">Git Hub for 
  Church Source</a>. I attend <a href="http://www.dominionchurch.org/">Dominion Church</a>, and as with all 
  organizations these days, we're looking to save money.  The church 
  puts a pretty good chunk of 
  money into "church management software" every year.  The current 
  solution the church uses is modular and charges you for each module.  
  The pastors have been asking me to write a replacement for the child 
  check-in system so they could save $900 yearly.  Since, our contract 
  is coming up for renewal, the topic has come up again.
</p>
<p>
  I looked around and found some good open source projects that do 
  church management but nothing that does check-in well.  So I finally 
  decided to bite the bullet and just do it.  I have just over two 
  weeks to get something written and running for January 23rd.  Using 
  <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> I'm going try to create an open source child check-in system 
  in the next two weeks.  The application will be web based, and 
  churches will be able to run it for free on any cheaply available 
  LAMP server (probably will work on Windows too).  I hope to have 80% 
  of the check-in system done by January 23rd.  It should at least be 
  functional by that date.  After the 23rd I'll try to polish it off in 
  another two weeks.

  However, the fun doesn't end there!  I would like to give churches a 
  viable alternative to these expensive proprietary systems. Eventually 
  I'd like to add more features so we can get off our propriety 
  application.  If you would like to get involved checkout the <a href="https://github.com/pizzapanther/Church-Source">Git Hub 
  project page</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=6eb9a&t=6eb9a.40">Google Moderator</a> to submit new ideas.
