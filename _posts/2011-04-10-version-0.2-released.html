<p>
  The next release of Church Source is available now!  This version's major driving feature was face recognition using 
  <a href="http://face.com/">Face.com's</a> API.  Currently, this can be used for face recognition during check in. 
  However, in the future photos will also be used to help secure checkout procedures.
</p>
<p>
  Also included were several bug fixes and <a href="http://www.picnik.com/">Picnik</a> integration to help crop faces from Household pictures.
