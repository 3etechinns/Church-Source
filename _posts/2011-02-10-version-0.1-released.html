  After several weeks of coding and a half dozen uses I've come up with the first release of Church Source.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B-GD95vnz4VFNTEyY2QxYjItMmU0Ny00M2Q5LThmMTEtMDY3YWYwMzlhZDgx&sort=name&layout=list&num=50">Download the tarball</a> 
  or go <a href="https://github.com/pizzapanther/Church-Source">check out the source</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The first release focuses on check-in and integrates for use with touch screens.  If you have a real touch screen like an iPad you can 
  skip these features because the iPad already has features like a virtual keyboard.  (However, I doubt you could use the iPad because you can't 
  hook up a label printer to it.)  The touch screen we use at Dominion Church is more simplistic and doesn't support swipes and such.  That is what 
  the touch screen features are geared towards.
</p>
<p>
  I hope to write some more documentation soon on how to install Church Source and setup a check-in station, so check the 
  <a href="https://github.com/pizzapanther/Church-Source/wiki">Wiki</a> frequently.
</p>
<p>
  Also don't forget to <a href="https://github.com/pizzapanther/Church-Source/issues">file issues</a> if you run into any problems.
